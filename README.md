# C343

These are my projects and labs for C343, which is data structures.
The projects were given mostly to us, but we had to do the TODO parts in them.
The GUI, main, and some tests were given to us.

The labs are mostly just my work. There might've been a little guidance/code at the
beginning but the students filled out most of the code to get the data structures
working and then using them properly.
